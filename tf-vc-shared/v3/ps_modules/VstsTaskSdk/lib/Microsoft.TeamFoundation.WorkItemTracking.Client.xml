            </summary>
            <remarks>
            This is currently only for internal use (hence the use of xxxData object), to let the GUI be data-driven 
            based on the same semantics enforced by the server, rather than being hard-coded, to make back-compat easier.
            
            This currently only supports getting metadata for objects that have been saved and have a 
            parent / project assigned, which is always the case in the current UI -- security can only be only 
            shown on items that have been saved and are visible under some parent in the tree.
            On objects that meet this criteria, this property should always return non-null, or throw.
            On objects that don't, this property will return null.
            
            ACL metadata is currently obtained and cached once per QueryHierarchy, on demand. If the metadata
            has not yet been obtained, accessing this property may try to load it from the server.

            full refresh. This is primarily for test use, to verify compatibility with the
            internal mid-Rosario release that used incremental mode.
            Without the default setting of this flag, which is the intended use Going forward, 
            we always pass rowVersion = 0 and get full results.
            With the introduction of query folder permissions, the server no longer fully supports 
            incremental mode, to avoid having to conceptually update cache stamps on any change
            to permissions or group membership.
            We no longer support IncrementalRefresh for Queries as of the new WIT Server Implementation.
            We are deprecating this property and warning consumers to stop using it.
            In the previous implementation, the RowVersion only specified that all queries + deleted since that row version
            should be returned.  We have validated that 2008, 2010, 2012, 2013 handle the non-existence of deleted queries without issue.

            <remarks>
            For a new query item, or an existing item that has been removed from the project hierarchy,
            this property will contain a default ACL that inherits all permissions from its parent, 
            but may not have those permissions populated in the extended permission data 
            (IAccessControlLIstEntry.ExtendedInfo).
            
            For existing query items that have not been removed from the hierarchy, the permissions 
            are currently obtained from the server on-demand when this property is accessed, and are 
            then cached until the next save.
            This property should always be non-null unless an exception occurs when obtaining 
            data from the server.

            <remarks>
            This is currently only for internal use (hence the use of xxxData object), to let the GUI be data-driven 
            based on the same semantics enforced by the server, rather than being hard-coded, to make back-compat easier.
            
            This currently only supports getting metadata for objects that have been saved and have a 
            parent / project assigned, which is always the case in the current UI -- security can only be only 
            shown on items that have been saved and are visible under some parent in the tree.
            On objects that meet this criteria, this property should always return non-null, or throw.
            On objects that don't, this property will return null.
            
            ACL metadata is currently obtained and cached once per QueryHierarchy, on demand. If the metadata
            has not yet been obtained, accessing this property may try to load it from the server.

             Gets the display name in the correct format for work item tracking. In most cases this will be the same as the identity's display
             name. However, if the user's display name is not unique this method will return a unique name of the form &quot;display name &lt;unique name&gt;&quot;.
             You should use this method to get the valid value when assigning to an identity field such as System.AssignedTo
             </summary>
             <remarks>
             As of TFS 2015 Identity fields in the WIT ClientOM ensure that identity values are always read/written uniquely.
             When you read from an identity field and that user's display name is unique you will get the display name returned:
            
             <code>
                     var workItemStore = teamProjectCollection.GetService();
                     var workItem = workItemStore.GetWorkItem(1);
                     Console.WriteLine(workItem.Fields["System.AssignedTo"].Value); // Jamal Hartnett
             </code>
            
             However, if the system has more than one Jamal Hartnett the field returns the combo-string:
            
             <code>
                     var workItemStore = teamProjectCollection.GetService();
                     var workItem = workItemStore.GetWorkItem(1);
                     Console.WriteLine(workItem.Fields["System.AssignedTo"].Value); // Jamal Hartnett &lt;abrikamfiber4@hotmail.com&gt;
             </code>
            
             The ClientOM tries to only show the combo-string when needed.However, it also requires the correct value when assigning an identity field.
             So, if you're assigning a value to an identity field, you need to make sure you pass the proper value.Fortunately, there is a helper function to make this easy calledGetValidDisplayName.
             This method has two overloads, one takes a TeamFoundationIdentity object and the other takes a DisplayName and UniqueName.
            
             Before assigning to an identity field you should call this method to ensure you are getting the right value to assign to.
            
            
            
             Example 1
            
             <code>
                     var identityService = teamProjectCollection.GetService();
                     var user = identityService.ReadIdentity(IdentitySearchFactor.AccountName, "fabrikamfiber4@hotmail.com", MembershipQuery.None, ReadIdentityOptions.None);
                     workItem.Fields["System.AssignedTo"].Value = workItemStore.GetValidDisplayName(user);
             </code>
            
            
             Example 2
            
             <code>
                     workItem.Fields["System.AssignedTo"].Value = workItemStore.GetValidDisplayName("Jamal Hartnett", "fabrikamfiber4@hotmail.com");
